# Load_Forecast_Model

In this project, I've developed a model based on 15+ years (2005-2021) of data to predict weather normalized load forecast for the New York City.

Sources of data:

Real time Actual Load: http://mis.nyiso.com/public/P-58Blist.htm

Daily weather: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access

Note: You'll need to create a personalized token to extract weather data from NOAA (Link: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token)
